## Startup-Outcome-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Pipeline
##  Project Overview
This project aims to **predict the outcome of startups**â€”whether they will succeed (Operating or IPO) or fail (Acquired or Closed)â€”using supervised machine learning techniques.  

The process includes:
- Preprocessing a dataset of startup companies
- Feature engineering (e.g., company age)
- Normalization and encoding of data
- Creating a binary target column `Active_Status` to classify startup status (1 = Active, 0 = Not Active)

This project was developed as part of my **Data Science Internship at Technocolabs**.

##  Dataset
Due to file size limitations, the dataset is available via Google Drive.

## Key Tasks Performed

-  Extracted `founded_year` from `founded_at`
-  Created `company_age` using: `2025 - founded_year`
-  Scaled numeric features using `MinMaxScaler`:
    - `funding_total_usd`
    - `funding_rounds`
    - `investment_rounds`
    - `company_age`
-  One-hot encoded categorical columns:
    - `category_code`
    - `country_code`
-  Created binary label column `Active_Status`
    - `1` = Active (Operating or IPO)
    - `0` = Not Active (Acquired or Closed)
-  Final cleaned dataset saved as `processed_companies_dataset.csv`

## ðŸ§ª Model Building

Model building not included in this part, but the dataset is now ready for supervised learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.
